# Employee Salary Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model that accurately predicts employee salaries based on various features such as experience, education, job role, and location. The system is aimed at helping HR departments make data-driven compensation decisions.

## 📌 Project Overview

Accurately predicting employee salaries can enhance fairness, reduce biases, and streamline HR processes. This capstone project uses regression models to develop a salary prediction system based on historical employee data.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Many organizations struggle with determining appropriate employee compensation due to the complexity of influencing factors. This project aims to:
- Predict salaries using historical data
- Automate salary recommendations
- Reduce manual effort and biases in HR decisions

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Handling**: pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn
- **Model Building**: scikit-learn
- **Model Deployment**: Streamlit / Flask
- **Model Serialization**: joblib or pickle


  
- ## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Perform exploratory data analysis
3. Encode categorical features
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
5. Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
6. Evaluate model performance using R² Score, MAE
7. Deploy the model using a web interface (optional)
